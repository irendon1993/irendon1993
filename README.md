### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm Isaac, I'm currently a Coding Instructor at theCoderSchool and in pursuit of an entry to early level career position as a software engineer. In my spare time I     love building full-stack web applications mainly in React and Spring but also have experience with Angular and .NET Core. 
- ðŸ’¡ Keep an eye out for my next project in the works, FitSync.
- ðŸ’ª It'll be an all-purpose fitness app that will help users maintain healthy life styles covering topics such as resitance training, nutrition, and meditation.
- ðŸ“š Some of my learning goals for the rest of the year:
  - Learn TypeScript! I really enjoy JavaScript but being able to used a strongly typed version of it seems like a game changer!
  - Start working with testing tools like Jest and Cypress. I feel that Test Driven Devlopment will truly improve my ability to design well structured solutions. 
  - Mastering the front-end! There's something about navigating a website with beautiful animations that inspires me to make greater strides in my design skills.
